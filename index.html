    <h3>NBA 2K18</h3>
    <p>So 2k dropped the prelude for <em>2K18</em> and it was way overhyped.</p>

    <h4>My Favorite Comic Book Character</h4>
    <p>Spider-Man is my favorite comic book character of all time. Spider-Man is usually a fan favorite amongst the younger group of readers mostly because they can relate to the character. <br/>The man under the mask is a nerdy teenage genius named Peter Parker. He gets straight A's, is #1 in his class, and has a very bright future because of his knowledge. <br/>Just like every other teenager he has problems with getting to class on time, trying to make his aunt proud of him, getting bullied, and trying to figure out who he is. We see him struggle the most with his identity because he doesn't know who he really is, Peter Parker or Spider-Man. Given that, so many young readers are drawn to his story.</p>
